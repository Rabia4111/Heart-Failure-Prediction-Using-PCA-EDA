Project Title
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on heart failure prediction.

Dataset
Heart failure prediction dataset.

Objective
To investigate and comprehend the correlations among the indicators of patient health and the existence of heart disease.

Steps Performed
1. Loaded data and checked the shape, column names and the datatype.
2. Explored numerical characteristics with histograms and boxplots.
3. Investigated categorical features with countplots.
4. Detected erroneous or questionable values like zero cholesterol.
5. Relied on a correlation matrix to get a hold of numerical feature relationships.
6. Cleaned up insights in case of data cleaning and further modeling.

Key Observations
Age, maxhr and oldpeak exhibit high visual discrepancy between heart disease and non-heart disease patients
cholesterol contains invalid zero values that need cleaning
the exercise induced angina and chest pain type is very predictive of the existence of heart diseases
heart disease is associated with flat and down st slope values.
predictive potential is also demonstrated by fasting blood sugar and some types of ecg.
